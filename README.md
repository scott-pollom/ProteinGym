# ProteinGym Fork

This is a fork of ProteinGym that adds the ability to include Foldseek sequences in the DMS data CSV files.

## Usage

To add Foldseek sequences to the DMS data CSV files, run the following command (after modifying the script for your local machine):

```
bash update_data_with_foldseek.sh
```

This will create a new directory containing the updated CSV files.

**Note:** You will need to have Foldseek installed in order to run this script. You can download Foldseek from [here](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek).
